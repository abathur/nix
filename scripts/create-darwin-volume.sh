    #
    # 2) system is in some sense less secure than user keychain... (it's
    # possible to read the password for decrypting the keychain) but
    # the user keychain appears to be available too late. As far as I
    # can tell, the file with this password (/var/db/SystemKey) is
    # inside the FileVault envelope. If that isn't true, it may make
    # sense to store the password inside the envelope?
    #
    # 3) At some point it would be ideal to have a small binary to serve
    # as the daemon itself, and for it to replace /usr/bin/security here.
    #
    # 4) *UserAgent exemptions should let the system seamlessly supply the
    # password if noauto is removed from fstab entry. This is intentional;
    # the user will hopefully look for help if the volume stops mounting,
    # rather than failing over into subtle race-condition problems.
