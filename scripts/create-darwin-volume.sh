# DOING: I'm adding a new idiom here for getting diskinfo because I feel like we're frittering
# a lot of time away doing all of these little xml checks relative to just extracting the info
# once and caching or passing it.
#
# There's one asterisk here, which is that the diskutil command is still expensive, so it may
# still make sense to run a cheaper check like volume_exists, since we can skip enumerating
# the volumes if we already know none of them are present
# TODO: unused

# most diskutil commands are atrociously slow to be using to answer individual
# queries/questions (diskutil apfs list -plist regularly takes .75-1.25s on my
# 2020 MBA) so we'll run it once and fling it through xslt to answer
# all of the questions we have.
#
# Another sad factor here is that we can actually get *most* of this information
# from ioreg with a similar process--but the encrypted and encryptiontype keys
# there don't seem to indicate whether it's FV-encrypted (they're always true on T2)
#
# So here I'll keep a list of the ways I've identified to test volume encryption:
#
# diskutil apfs unlockVolume -verify with an intentionally-bad password:
# - ~100ms to fail on disk not encrypted
# - ~180ms to fail on bad password
# - plus time to disambiguate the above failures
#
# diskutil apfs decryptVolume with an intentionally-bad password:
# - ~60ms to fail on disk not encrypted
# - ~225ms to fail on bad password
# - plus time to disambiguate
#
# diskutil info -plist disk1s8 | xmllint --xpath
# - ballpark 250-300ms for both cases
# - directly fails
# - BUT: if you already have to pull diskutil info for this disk
#   it's only about ~7ms *more* to run this test
#
# diskutil apfs listCryptoUsers <special>
# - ~40ms for status 1 if there's no disk
# - ~60ms for status 0 if there are no crypto users
# - ~100ms for status 0 if there are crypto users (~90ms if plist)
# - I don't *know* this perfectly correlates, but it seems likely
#
# security find-generic-password -s <UUID>
# - ~50-80ms hit or miss
# - this doesn't strongly correlate, but we *will* have to pull it
#   if we find out that the disk is encrypted, so if we've already
#   got some strong context clues, it *might* make sense to just
#   try fetching the password, use unlock -verify, skate if we pass
#   and parse output to figure out if we're actually encrypted
#   if we fail?
#
# diskutil apfs list -plist | xsltproc
# - as noted before, this is very slow .75-1.25s, but it does score
#   us most of the information we need for all volumes (and the
#   xsltproc is fairly cheap with --novalid), so it seems at least
#   plausible that, once you pencil out all of the checks, it'll
#   be "better" in some clear way to just hard pull all of the volumes at once
# - yes filevault
# - no mountpoint
#
# ioreg -ra -n "Nix Store" | xsltproc
# - This is *very* quick for the information we get (~50ms) w/o
#   any caching, but it doesn't have everything we want (namely, mountpoint
#   and whether we have filevault)
#
# /System/Library/Filesystems/apfs.fs/Contents/Resources/apfs.util -k disk1s7
# - This is about 20ms on first run and 11 after; not bad, but we do already
#   need to know the device (and I'm not certain we will when this would be
#   most helpful?)
#
# /bin/df -nlP /nix
# - get the special device in ~5-15ms
# - plus parse time
#
# /usr/bin/stat -f "%Sd" /nix
# - special device in ~8-10ms, no parsing needed
# - this can, in theory, lie; if our new volume doesn't mount for some reason
#   it'll just report the root special device
#
# this extracts one lozenge(◊)-separated list per volume where the label is
# "Nix Store" or "$NIX_VOLUME_LABEL"
